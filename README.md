# Stock_Price_Predictions
Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. 
In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. 
We will develop this project into two parts:-  

1) We will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network. 
2) We will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.
